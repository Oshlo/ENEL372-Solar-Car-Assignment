# ENEL372 Solar Car Assignment
> Adam Finlayson

The objective of this assignment is to design and build a power electronic circuit used to power a remote-control model solar car. The model solar car is powered by a 10W solar panel [1] and is driven by a DC motor connected to a gear box. The model solar car is steered by a servo connected to a separate power source. A power electronic circuit is required as the DC motor cannot be powered directly from the solar panel. The DC motor requires ~1 Amp to run while the solar panel can only supply a maximum of ~0.3 Amps.
